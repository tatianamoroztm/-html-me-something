    <p>I was born and raised in a small  town  called Uman, located  in central Ukraine. It is a beautiful town with a very rich history, and most known for Dendrological Park Sofiyivka . Every year over half a million tourists from all over the world come to Uman to visit this, as many people refer to it, "eighth Wonder of the World". </p>

    <h2>Sofia Potocka</h2>
   <p>The park was planned in 1796 by Uman’s governor at the time, the Polish Count Stanisław Potocki. Sofiyivka park was a birthday present for his Greek wife Sofia , and was named after her.  Compatriots of her time wrote: "She was beautiful as a dream, a child of southern countries. All those who have seen her admire her beauty, igniting a fire in the hearts of men and envy in the eyes of women." </p>

    <h2>Sculptures</h2>
    <p>The park created in romantic style using Greek mythology. This idea belonged to Sofia who missed her native country very much. Like the Taj Mahal in India, it is a symbol of great love. </p>

 <h2>Design</h2>
   <p>Designer and contractor - Polish military engineer Ludwig Metzell gathered plants from many parts of Europe. The park is decorated with a number of sculptures, mostly antique ones, and artificial cliffs, grottoes, and gazebos. </p>

   <h2> When to visit</h2>
    
    <p>The Sofiyivka Park is beautiful in any season, but I always loved to visit it in fall with vibrant orange colors and cooler weather it just takes my breath away.</p>
